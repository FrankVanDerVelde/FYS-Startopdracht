                                A drag queen is a person, usually male, who uses
                                drag clothing
                                and makeup to imitate and often exaggerate
                                female gender
                                signifiers and gender roles for entertainment
                                purposes.

                            <p>
                                Historically, most drag queens have been men
                                dressing as women.
                                In modern times, drag queens are associated with
                                gay men and gay
                                culture, but they can be of any gender and
                                sexual identity.
                                People partake in the activity of doing drag for
                                reasons ranging
                                from self-expression to mainstream performance.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Drag shows frequently include lip-syncing, live
                                singing, and
                                dancing. They occur at events like gay pride
                                parades and drag
                                pageants and in venues such as cabarets and
                                nightclubs. Drag
                                queens vary by type, culture, and dedication,
                                from professionals
                                who star in films to people who do drag only
                                occasionally.

                                The origin of the term drag is uncertain. The
                                first recorded use
                                of drag in reference to actors dressed in
                                women's clothing is
                                from 1870. It may have been based on the term
                                "grand rag" which
                                was historically used for a masquerade ball. For
                                much of
                                history, drag queens were men, but in more
                                modern times,
                                cisgender and trans women, as well as non-binary
                                people, also
                                perform as drag queens.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                In a 2018 article, Psychology Today stated that
                                drag queens are
                                "most typically gay cisgender men (though there
                                are many drag
                                queens of varying sexual orientations and gender
                                identities)".
                                Examples of trans-feminine drag queens,
                                sometimes called trans
                                queens, include Monica Beverly Hillz and
                                Peppermint. Cisgender
                                female drag queens are sometimes called faux
                                queens or
                                bioqueens, though both terms are problematic:
                                faux carries the
                                connotation that the drag is fake, and the use
                                of bioqueen
                                exclusively for cisgender females is a misnomer
                                since
                                trans-feminine queens exhibit gynomorphic
                                features.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Drag queens' counterparts are drag kings:
                                performers, usually
                                women, who dress in exaggeratedly masculine
                                clothing. Trans men
                                who dress like drag kings are sometimes termed
                                trans kings. Drag
                                has been argued to be an over-expression of the
                                stereotypical
                                female look. Drag is known to break down gender
                                norms and can
                                thus be seen as 'gender bending'.

                                The first person known to describe himself as
                                "the queen of
                                drag" was William Dorsey Swann, born enslaved in
                                Hancock,
                                Maryland, who in the 1880s started hosting drag
                                balls in
                                Washington, DC attended by other men who were
                                formerly enslaved,
                                and often raided by the police, as documented in
                                the newspapers.
                                In 1896, Swann was convicted and sentenced to 10
                                months in jail
                                on the false charge of "keeping a disorderly
                                house" (euphemism
                                for running a brothel) and requested a pardon
                                from the president
                                for holding a drag ball (the request was
                                denied).

                                drag queen in the
                                United States was influenced by the development
                                of the blackface
                                minstrel show. Originally the performers would
                                only mock African
                                American men, but as time went on they found it
                                amusing to mock
                                African American femininity as well. They
                                performed in comedic
                                skits, dances, and "wench" songs.
